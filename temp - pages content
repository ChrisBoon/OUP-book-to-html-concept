              <h1>How to Make a Strong First Impression</h1>
              <div class="cols">
                <p>You've heard it before: You only have one chance to make a first impression. According to research, we have about ten seconds with <strong>strangers</strong> before they form an opinion of us.</p>
                <h2>Body Language and Appearance</h2>
                <p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> a good attitude with your body. When you first walk into a room, show <strong>confidence</strong>. Stand up straight and look other people in the eye. If you smile frequently, it will make other people more comfortable. They will think you are friendly.</p>
                <p>Appearance is important. Several years ago, a professional colleague offered to meet me for lunch. I wore a sport coat and tie. He showed up in shorts and sandals. The message I received was: "Bill, meeting you is a rather ordinary experience. I don't need to present a businesslike appearance." Not surprisingly, that was the last time I met with him. True, <strong>standards</strong> for appropriate clothing have changed a lot. Maybe the best advice I can share came from someone I met. She said, "I don't dress for the job I have now; I dress for the job I want to have."</p>
                <h2>Voice</h2>
                <p>The way you speak also affects the first impression you make. Listeners judge our intelligence, our level of <strong>cultural</strong> knowledge, even our leadership ability by the words we <strong>select</strong>&ndash;and by how we say them. Your listeners hear your tone of voice before they begin listening to your words. Speak clearly and loudly enough so that people can hear you. Change the pitch of your voice to avoid a dull <span class="glossary_item">monotone<span class="glossary_term"><strong>monotone:</strong> a way of speaking in which the tone and volume remain the same.</span></span> Show expression in both your voice and your face. And try not to speak too quickly.</p>
                <h2>Conversation Skills</h2>
                <p>The greatest way to make a good first impression is to demonstrate that the other person, not you, is the center of attention. When you are only interested in talking about yourself, other people don't feel that you <strong>appreciate</strong> them. Show that you are interested in others. Then new acquaintances will want to see you again. Recently I went to a conference. At lunch, my wife and I sat with several people we didn't know. While most of the people made good impressions, one man did not. He talked about himself the entire time. No one else got a chance to speak. Unfortunately, he probably thought we were interested in his life story. We decided to avoid him all weekend. I like this definition of a bore: "Somebody who talks about himself so much that you don't get to talk about yourself."</p>
                <p>You'll <strong>impress</strong> other people when you practice good listening skills. Give interested responses: "Hmmm ... interesting!" "Tell me more, please." "What did you do next?" Your partner will welcome your help in keeping the conversation going. You also show you're a good listener when you <strong>maintain</strong> steady eye contact. Think about how you feel when someone you are talking to looks around the room. You think the person would rather be talking to someone else. Try to use the name of the person you've just met frequently. "Judy, I like that suggestion." "Your vacation must have been exciting, Fred." You show that you have paid attention from the start, catching the name during the introduction. Equally important, you'll make conversations more personal by including the listener's name several times.</p>
                <p>Finally, avoid making other people uncomfortable. Be careful with jokes. Something you think is funny may be <strong>offensive</strong> to others. You don't want to hurt someone's feelings. Also, don't disagree with someone you have just met. If you disagree too much in your first conversation, the other person may think you are just too different. When you know the person better, you can express another opinion.</p>

                <p><strong>Demonstrate</strong> a good attitude with your body. When you first walk into a room, show <strong>confidence</strong>. Stand up straight and look other people in the eye. If you smile frequently, it will make other people more comfortable. They will think you are friendly.</p>
                <p>Appearance is important. Several years ago, a professional colleague offered to meet me for lunch. I wore a sport coat and tie. He showed up in shorts and sandals. The message I received was: "Bill, meeting you is a rather ordinary experience. I don't need to present a businesslike appearance." Not surprisingly, that was the last time I met with him. True, <strong>standards</strong> for appropriate clothing have changed a lot. Maybe the best advice I can share came from someone I met. She said, "I don't dress for the job I have now; I dress for the job I want to have."</p>
                <p>Finally, avoid making other people uncomfortable. Be careful with jokes. Something you think is funny may be <strong>offensive</strong> to others. You don't want to hurt someone's feelings. Also, don't disagree with someone you have just met. If you disagree too much in your first conversation, the other person may think you are just too different. When you know the person better, you can express another opinion.</p>

# OUP-book-to-html-concept

Concept developed in 2013 looking at feasibility of directly transferring printed book design into interactive html.
The idea was to take pages from an existing text book and recreate as faithfully as possible, whilst still including interactive elements.
Limited progress was made and it was quickly abandoned. In part it was due to the complexity of recreating the design with CSS that would work across browsers at that time - an issue that will be much reduced now.
